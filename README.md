### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Start with three HTML pages. One for login and one for write reviews, and one for displaying reviews.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, choice display, display the product reviews data from different site, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving review data
  - submitting new reviews
- **DB/Login** - Store users, people's reviews in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't review a product unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each review got liked, their likes are broadcast to all other users.

## HTML deliverable

‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the `Startup HTML` deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- [ ] **HTML pages** - Three HTML page that represent the ability to login and display reviews and write reviews.
- [ ] **Links** - The login page automatically links to the Home page(home page contains product review products). The Home page has a link to the write review page.
- [ ] **Text** - The login page has a login form. The Home page has a list of products with reviews. The write review page has a form to write a review.
- [ ] **Images** - Images will be added for represent the products.
- [ ] **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The voting choices represent data pulled from the database.
- [ ] **WebSocket** -

## CSS deliverable

‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the `Startup CSS` deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- [ ] **Header, footer, and main content body**
- [ ] **Navigation elements** -
- [ ] **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices
- [ ] **Application elements** - Used good contrast and whitespace
- [ ] **Application text content** - Consistent fonts
- [ ] **Application images** -

## React deliverable

‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the `Startup React` deliverable

For this deliverable I used JavaScript and React so that the application completely works for a single user. I also added placeholders for future technology.

- [ ] **Bundled and transpiled** - done!
- [ ] **Components** - Login, voting list, vote are all components with mocks for login, WebSocket.
  - [ ] **login** - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the voting page.
  - [ ] **database** - Displayed the voting counts. Currently this is stored and retrieved from local storage, but it will be replaced with the database data later.
  - [ ] **WebSocket** - I used the setInterval function to periodically increase a random vote count. This will be replaced with WebSocket messages later.
  - [ ] **application logic** - The highlight and ranking number change based up the user's selections.
- [ ] **Router** - Routing between login and voting components.
- [ ] **Hooks** - Vue uses class properties instead of `UseState` to track changes in vote state.

## Service deliverable

‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the `Startup Service` deliverable

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that receives votes and returns the voting totals.

- [ ] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - done!
- [ ] **Static middleware for frontend** - done!
- [ ] **Calls to third party endpoints** - I didn't have time to implement this. üòî
- [ ] **Backend service endpoints** - Placeholders for login that stores the current user on the server. Endpoints for voting.
- [ ] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - I did this using the fetch function.

## DB/Login deliverable

‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the `Startup DB/Login` deliverable

For this deliverable I associate the votes with the logged in user. I stored the votes in the database.

- [ ] **MongoDB Atlas database created** - done!
- [ ] **Stores data in MongoDB** - done!
- [ ] **User registration** - Creates a new account in the database.
- [ ] **existing user** - Stores the votes under the same user if the user already exists.
- [ ] **Use MongoDB to store credentials** - Stores both user and their votes.
- [ ] **Restricts functionality** - You cannot vote until you have logged in. This is restricted on the frontend only. üòî

## WebSocket deliverable

‚û°Ô∏è The following is an example of the required information for the `Startup WebSocket` deliverable

For this deliverable I used webSocket to update the votes on the frontend in realtime.

- [ ] **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - done!
- [ ] **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - done!
- [ ] **Data sent over WebSocket connection** - done!
- [ ] **WebSocket data displayed** - All user votes display in realtime. I'm really proud that this is working. Way cool!
